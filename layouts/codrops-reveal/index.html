            Build your own “do-everything-yourself” Bitcoin full node that will make you a sovereign peer in the Bitcoin
            and Lightning network.

            No need to trust anyone else.

            What is the RaspiBolt?
            With this guide, you can set up a Bitcoin and Lightning node from scratch, doing everything yourself. You
            will learn about Linux, Bitcoin, and Lightning. As a result, you’ll have your very own RaspiBolt node, built
            by you and no one else.

            There are many reasons why you should run your own Bitcoin node.

            Keep Bitcoin decentralized. Use your node to help enforce your Bitcoin consensus rules.
            Take back your sovereignty. Let your node validate your own Bitcoin transactions. No need to ask someone
            else to tell you what’s happening in the Bitcoin network.
            Improve your privacy. Connect your wallets to your node so that you no longer need to reveal their whole
            financial history to external servers.
            Be part of Lightning. Run your own Lightning node for everyday payments and help building a robust,
            decentralized Bitcoin Lightning network.
            Did we mention that it’s fun, as well?

            RaspiBolt overview
            This guide explains how to set up your own Bitcoin node on a cheap Raspberry Pi. But it works on most
            hardware platforms because it only uses standard Debian Linux commands.

            Features
            Your Bitcoin node will offer the following functionality:

            Bitcoin: direct and trustless participation in the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, full validation of blocks
            and transactions
            Electrum server: connect your compatible wallets (including hardware wallets) to your own node
            Blockchain Explorer: web-based Explorer to privately look up transactions, blocks, and more
            Lightning: full client with stable long-term channels and a web-based management interface
            Always on: services are constantly synced and available 24/7
            Reachable from anywhere: connect to all your services through the Tor network
