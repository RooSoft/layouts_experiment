## How to run

Run this to enable tailwind css standalone to refresh styles as code is being written

```bash
tailwindcss -i app.css -o ./layouts/css/styles.css --watch

Serve the `layouts` folder using a server such as [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plugin.
